A-If you are freelance or homeoffice it's great this GitHub thing. 

Q-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A-The remote repository is public so you might doublecheck the changes made to your code.

Q-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A-Forks work only with GitHub, Clones work with repositories local or remote and Branches are just local.

Q-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A-It makes easier to track a previous commit.

Q-How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
